This module provides VDBRagIngest, a VDBRag subclass with nv_ingest support.

VDBRagIngest combines VDBRag (pure abstract base) with VDB from nv_ingest_client,
providing full ingestion capabilities. This class should be used by ingestor_server
and any components that require nv_ingest functionality.

For components that only need retrieval operations (like rag_server), use VDBRag
from vdb_base.py instead to avoid the nv_ingest dependency.

        This class combines the VDBRag abstract interface with the VDB class from

        nv_ingest ingestion operations.

        Use this class when:
        - You need to perform document ingestion via nv_ingest
        - You're working in the ingestor_server context

        - You only need retrieval operations
